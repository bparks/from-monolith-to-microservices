From Monolith to Microservices
==============================

This repository is the companion to the video at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6OnsQlKBAY4,
where I show concrete steps to take a monolithic application and convert it into microservices.
The implementation is with C# (usign an ASP.NET Core MVC application), but the concepts apply
to any program, even one that isn't a web app.
